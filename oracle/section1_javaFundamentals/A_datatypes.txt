primitive datatypes are the ones which don't use new keyword to initialize
int char byte boolean short float double long
4   2    1    undef   2     4     8      8   --> bytes
primitives are stored in stack memory 
non -primitives are in heap memory

initialization of primitives are done by literals i.e fixed values we can represent directly in code.
eg 3 'a' 343.34 true etc...

there are 3 logical operators && || !
